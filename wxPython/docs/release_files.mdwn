wxWidgets 2.9.4
===============

This directory contains the files for wxWidgets 2.9.4 release.

Please notice that since the 2.9 series only a single source distribution is
provided instead of the multiple distributions containing only the files for
each port as was done before. So you only need to download wxWidgets-2.9.4.zip
(or .7z for much smaller archive size) for Microsoft Windows systems or
wxWidgets-2.9.4.tar.bz2 for Unix ones, including Mac OS X. The only difference
between these files is that the ZIP (and 7z) archives contain files with DOS
line endings while the tar balls contain files with Unix line endings.


Note for Windows users: as an experiment, we also provide, for the first time,
pre-built binaries of wxMSW port built using several versions of Microsoft
Visual C++ compiler. They are available from the `binaries` subdirectory.
Please notice that the files in this directory, including
wxWidgets-2.9.4-Setup.exe file, contain *only* the sources and do **not**
include any binaries, so you will need to build the library after downloading
them. Please see `docs/msw/install.txt` for instructions.
